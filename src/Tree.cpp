//Arrayï¼Œ Linked List, stack, queue are linear data structures;

/*we consider three key elements of a data structure:
1.cost of operations (time complexity)
2.memory usage (space complexity)
3.ease of implementation*/

/*Tree is a hierarchical data structure/recursive data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.
A tree is connection of nodes with following properties:
1.one node is designated as root
2.each node contains a value
3.each node may have a list of child nodes
4.each node (except root) has exactly one parent node
5.nodes with no children are called leaves
6.children of a node are siblings to each other
7.there is exactly one path between any two nodes in the tree
N nodes have N-1 edges
8.ancestral relationship: if there is a path from node A to node B, then A is an ancestor of B and B is a descendant of A
9.depth of a node: length og path /number of edges from root to that node
10.height of a node: number of edges on the longest path from that node to a leaf
11.height of tree: height of the root node
12.degree of a node: number of children of that node
13.degree of tree: maximum degree of any node in the tree
14.subtree: any node and all its descendants form a subtree(recursive definition)


Common types of trees:
1.Binary Tree
2.Binary Search Tree
3.AVL Tree
4.Red-Black Tree
5.B-Trees
6.Trie
7.Heap


Basic operations on trees:
1.Insertion
2.Deletion
3.Traversal (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level order)
4.Searching
5.Find Min/Max
6.Find Height/Depth
7.Check if Balanced
8.Find Ancestors/Descendants
9.Find LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor)
10.Convert to other data structures (like linked list, array, etc.)*/
